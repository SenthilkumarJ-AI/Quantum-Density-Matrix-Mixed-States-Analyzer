# Quantum Density Matrix & Mixed States Analyzer

An interactive, Colab-ready project to explore **quantum mixed states**, **density matrices**, and **decoherence** using Qiskit. This analyzer moves beyond pure-state quantum mechanics and visualizes realistic quantum behavior under noise with intuitive UI/UX components.

---

## 📌 Motivation

Most introductory quantum simulations assume **pure states**, but real quantum systems interact with their environment and evolve into **mixed states**. This project helps bridge that gap by providing hands-on visualization of:

- State purity loss  
- Bloch vector shrinkage  
- Noise-induced decoherence  
- Fidelity degradation  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- Density Matrix Formalism  
- Pure vs Mixed States  
- Bloch Vector Representation  
- Partial Trace  
- Decoherence Intuition  
- Quantum Noise Models
